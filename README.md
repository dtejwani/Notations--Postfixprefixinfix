# Notations--Postfixprefixinfix
It implements a Deque (Double-Ended Queue) and use that data structure to write a class that can convert between the three common mathematical notation for arithmetic.  The three notations are:  Postfix (Reverse Polish) Notation: Operators are written after operands A B - C + == (A - B) + C  Infix Notation: The standard notation we use where the operator is between the operands.  Prefix (Polish) Notation: Operators are written before operands: * - A B C == (A - B) * C   The converter will be able to convert from one of those three to any other. The input will be a string written in a single notation, and the output will be the conversion to the specified notation.
